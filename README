domafolape - documents management for lazy people.

== Overview ==

I have a need to scan single- and multi-page documents with ADF scanner
(I'm using Brother MFC5460CN at the moment) and store them on my computer.
I want to assign these scanned documents some numbers, envelope numbers.
Then I would scan my documents, put them in appropriate, numbered envelopes,
put envelopes in box(es), and put boxes at the very bottom of my closet.

All that fuss will be made, because when I need some specific document,
I would rather search their electronic images than search real paper sheets.
And if I needed a real paper document I will know exactly where it is (which
box, which envelope, and there will be only a few documents in envelope, so
it would be easy then). It's kind of a hashtable for real life documents.

If I will have some time I will add bells and whistles:
 * fulltext search with help of OCR
 * tagging, categorizing
 * cloud-backed storage, for backup and redundancy
 * encryption, for security (must-have in a cloud!)
 * making tee (with help of lego mindstorm or some simple kind of robot)
 
If you find this software useful - let me know. It will encourage me to
develop it even more, suggestions and bug reports are especially welcome.
If you don't, I'll probably end up with something barely useful, pretty ugly
piece of software that will lose or corrupt your precious files on first
possible occasion.

== Technology ==

I'm willing to create web application, but I will start with regular gui app,
probably using Windows Presentation Foundation, definitely in C#.

For scanner-related technology, I'm willing to use Windows Image Acquisition libraries.

Wish me luck :-)

I really appreciate you read all of that.
